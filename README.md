# SitterSchedule 

### Simplifying Parents Lives 

## Project Description

We’re going to be creating a baby-sitter calendar company. Parents will create an account, add sitters they use, and then when they have a time they need a sitter, we’ll take care of contacting sitters and seeing who is available. Parents will be able to rank sitters in order of preference. Parents will also be able to connect with other parents that use the site to recommend or request recommendations of sitters.

## Team

I’m looking for one or two others to join the team. 

## SQL

I’m not sure yet which relational database. 

## No-SQL

I’m currently thinking of using a graph database once the SQL database is outgrown, but I’m willing to listen to suggestions. 

## Business

Since we’re expecting a high level of very specific traffic, funding will come from adds from companies that want to reach parents with young children. 

## Legal

The business will be a Utah LLC. 

## Technical 

1. Choose an initial SQL database for a prototype
2. Choose both client-side and server-side programming languages
3. Implement the MVP
